FoodREST - A RESTful API for food nutrition information.

This is an ASP.NET REST API that allows you to create, update, delete, and query food nutrition info. The point of the project was to build a RESTful API while following the Clean Architecture pattern.
I realize that for the size of this project, the Clean Architecture approach is probably adding more complexity than it is worth. That's ok, as the idea was just to learn and practice the pattern.
